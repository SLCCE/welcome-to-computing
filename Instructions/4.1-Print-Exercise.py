# Let's practice printing messages to your friends

# example
# a class example of printing in computer science is the "hello world"
# message. Below, an example of hello world is written
print("Hello world!")

      
# problem 1
# in the space below, write a print statement that says Hello world!
# tips: make sure you have two parenthesis, two quotes, and a message inside the quotes



# example 2
# sometimes, we want to print multiple things, or have a custom message
# the code below shows you how you can print out a message to with a person's name
name = "Madison" #P.S. what type is this variable? The line of code below will check

print("The variable name has a type of : ", type(name))

print("Hi, ", name)

# problem 2
# create a variable that is your name, or anything else that you want to print,
# using the format shown above


# example 3
# you can print as many things as you want in one print statement-- like the example below
school = "NC State"
mascot = "Wolfpack"
sport = "football"
students = 40000

print("The best school ever is the ", school, " ", mascot, "and they're really good at ", sport, 
     "and they have ", students, " students")

# in the example above, what happens if you remove the commas? the space between school and mascot? 
# there's nothing wrong with causing errors in the code, it's how you learn!

# problem 3
# using the example above, build your own sentence with various types!
