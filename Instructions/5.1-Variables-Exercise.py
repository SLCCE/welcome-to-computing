# Let's practice printing messages to your friends!

# Example
# A class example of printing in computer science is the "hello world"
# message. Below, an example of hello world is written.
print("Hello world!")

      
# Problem 1
# In the space below, write a print statement that says Hello world!
# Tips: make sure you have two parenthesis, two quotes, and a message inside the quotes.



# Example 2
# Sometimes, we want to print multiple things, or have a custom message.
# The code below shows you how you can print out a message with a person's name.
name = "Madison" #P.S. what type is this variable? The line of code below will check.

print("The variable name has a type of : ", type(name))

print("Hi, ", name)

# Problem 2
# Create a variable that is your name, or anything else that you want to print,
# using the format shown above.


# Example 3
# You can print as many things as you want in one print statement-- like the example below.
school = "NC State"
mascot = "Wolf"
sport = "football"
students = 40000

print("The best school ever is the ", school, " ", mascot, "and they're really good at ", sport, 
     "and they have ", students, " students")

# In the example above, what happens if you remove the commas? the space between school and mascot? 
# There's nothing wrong with causing errors in the code; it's how you learn!

# Problem 3
# Using the example above, build your own sentence with various types!
