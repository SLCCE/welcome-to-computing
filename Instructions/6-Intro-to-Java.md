# Introduction to Java

## What is Java?

Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language that's used for various web applications and custom software development projects.

## Why Learn Java?

Java is a popular programming language that is commonly used in industry and by various academic institutions. Globally, Java is considered one of the top three programming languages.

The five principles of Java are:
- **Simple, object-oriented, and familiar**: Java should be easy to use, with intuitive naming conventions and similar flow to other programming langauges
- **Robust and secure**: Java should be easy to understand and limit security vulnerabilities
- **Architecture-neutral and portable**: one of the things that makes Java so popular is that it is portable, meaning it can be transported from device to device
- **It must execute with high performance**: Java should run quickly and without hitting major errors
- **It must be interpreted, threaded, and dynamic**: these are all factors that allow Java to be an effective language to use for programmers from various backgrounds and across multiple platforms

## How is Java Used in the Real World?

Java is one of the most popular programming languages in the world:
**Mobile applications**
**Cloud applications** (largely due to architecture neutrality and dynamic threading)
**Chatbots and marketing tools** (largely due to dynamic threading)
**Enterprise-level cloud solutions** 
**Support AI applications**

If you have an interest in going into software engineering, Java might be a great option for you!

## Why Java for SLCCE?

For our SLCCE coding workshops, Java serves as a great option for challenging yourself:
- **Easy to Learn**: Java has a similar syntax to Python, making it easy to learn and translate from your previous SLCCE workshops
- **Advanced Structure**: Java uses a class structure, which is more similar to real-world computer science programs
- **Strong Community Support**: As part of SLCCE, you’ll have access to a wide array of Java tutorials and collaborative projects

We hope you’ll enjoy learning Java and discover how it can open doors to exciting opportunities in tech!
