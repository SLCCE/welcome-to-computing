# Java Escape Sequences

This lesson will introduce you to escape sequences in Java: way to control how text appears when your program runs.

## What Are Escape Sequences?

Escape sequences are special characters used inside strings to do things like:

- Move to a new line
- Add a tab space
- Include quote marks
- And more!

They always start with a backslash (`\`). Think of the backslash as a signal to the compiler that the text will be formatted differently

## Syntax

| Escape Sequence | Name/Meaning      | Description                                                | Example Output       |
| --------------- | ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| `\n`            | New Line          | Moves the cursor to the next line                          | Hello<br>World       |
| `\t`            | Tab               | Inserts a horizontal tab (like 4-8 spaces)                 | Java  is  cool       |
| `\"`            | Double Quote      | Allows you to include `"` inside a string                  | She said, "Yes!"     |
| `\'`            | Single Quote      | Allows `'` inside single-quoted strings\*                  | It\'s Java!          |
| `\\`            | Backslash         | Prints a backslash character                               | C:\Java\bin          |
| `\r`            | Carriage Return   | Returns the cursor to the beginning of the line (rare use) | Might overwrite line |
| `\b`            | Backspace         | Deletes the previous character (system-dependent)          | Hell\blo → Hello     |
| `\uXXXX`        | Unicode Character | Inserts a Unicode char                                     |

### Example Code

```java
public class EscapeExamples {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello,\nworld!");            // New line
        System.out.println("Java\tis\tfun!");            // Tab spaces
        System.out.println("She said, \"Hi there!\"");   // Quotation marks
        System.out.println("C:\\Users\\Student");        // Backslashes
    }
}
```

### Outputs

```
Hello,
world!
Java    is    fun!
She said, "Hi there!"
C:\Users\Student
```
