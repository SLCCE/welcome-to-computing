# Compound Printing
When we want to print multiple operations with one line, it is sometimes beneficial to use something referred to as **compound printing**. 

This is a practice where multiple statements are combined into one line, allowing us to perform operations and output data. This ability will be important in our next topic
    
    
## Example 1: Here is a basic example of a compound print statement

```
print("The type of 4.5 is ", type_of(4.5), ".")
>>> The type of 4.5 is <class 'float'>.
```

## Example 2: Here is a more complex example of a compound print statement

```
print("The type of 4.5 is ", type(4.5), ", and the type of 'hello!' is ", type('hello!'), ".")
>>> The type of 4.5 is <class 'float'>, and the type of 'hello!' is <class 'str'>.
```
