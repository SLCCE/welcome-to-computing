# The Else Statement

## What is it?

Now that we know we know we can have our program run a code block if a condition is true, the Else Statement runs a code block if the condition is false.

The Else Statement functions as follows

    if condition is true:
        do this
    else: #if condition is false
        do this

If the condition is true, the if statement will run, but if the condition is false, the else statement is run. Both cannot run, only one or the other.

### Syntax

    #NEED TO HAVE AN IF STATEMENT TO ADD AN ELSE STATEMENT

    #Keyword to start the else statement

    #No need for a condition because else only cares if the original condition is not met

    else: #Colon ends line

        code runs #Only runs if the condition is false

## Example

Going back to our example from the if statement reading, we are going to add an else statement to our previous example

    print("Welcome to the program")

    x = 11

    if x > 10:

        print("Bigger than 10")

    else: #Invoke else statement

        #This code will run if x is not greater than 10

        print("Less than 10")

    print("Goodbye")

If we run the program now after we change the variable from 11 to 5

    x = 5

The output will not be

    Welcome to the program
    Less than 10
    Goodbye

The program printed "Less than 10" because the condition in the if statement was false.
