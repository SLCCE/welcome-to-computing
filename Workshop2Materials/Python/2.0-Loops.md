# Introduction to Loops

Computers are really good at following specific instructions quickly. Oftentimes we will want a computer to do something multiple times. To do this, we can use loops. 

## What is a loop?

A loop is a structure that allows a set of instructions to run repeatedly. For example, if I wanted the computer to do something 10 times, 
the code would look like this. 

10 times: \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;do something

## Use cases
* everything
* more specific:
    * processing each item in a list
    * file handling
    * simulation
    * algorithms
