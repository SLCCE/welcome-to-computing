# The If Statement

## What is it?

So far we have learned about how to check if a certain condition is true or false. The If Statement is how we can use conditions to have the program to do different things.

The If Statement functions as follows:

    code before

    if condition is true:
        do this

    code after

If the condition is not true, then the code under the If Statement does not run

### Syntax

    #Keyword if starts the if-statement

    if true condition: #Colon ends the condition

        code runs #This line runs if and only if the condition is true

## Example

We are going to create a simple program where the program is going to run if a variable has a value that is greater than 10

    print("Welcome to the program") #This line will run no matter what

    #Create our variable that stores value 11
    x = 11

    if x > 10:

        #If the variable is bigger than 10, then this will be printed
        print("Bigger than 10")

    #This line will run no matter what
    print("Goodbye")

The output for the above code will be

    Welcome to the program
    Bigger than 10
    Goodbye

We can run the code again, but we will change the value of the variable from 11 to 5

    x = 5

The output will now be

    Welcome to the program
    Goodbye

The program did not print "Bigger than 10" because the condition in the if statement was false, and the if statement will only run if the condition is true.
