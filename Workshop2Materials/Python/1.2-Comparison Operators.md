# Comparison Operators

## What are comparison operators?

As the name suggests, a comparison operator is an operator (like +, -, *, /) that compares two values that we give the program.

We are essentially asking the following

* Is A equal to B?
* Is B equal to B?
* Is A not equal to B?
* Is A less than B?
* If B greater than A?

A mathematical operator will return a number, but comparison operator only returns true or false.

## Comparison Operators in Python

    > #Greater than
    < #Less than
    >= #Greater than or equal to
    <= #Less than or equal to
    == #Equals
    != #Not equals

## Using Comparison Operators

Now that we know the comparison operators we can see how they are used

    print(2 > 1) #Checking if 2 is greater than 1
    >>> True

    print( 3 < 2) #Checking if 3 is less than 5
    >>> False

    print(5 >= 5) #Checking if 5 is less than or equal to 5
    >>> True

    print(4 <= 6) #Checking if 4 is less than or equal to 6
    >>> True

    print(5 == 5) #Checking if 5 is equal to 5
    >>> True

    print(4 != 6) #Checking if 4 is not equal to 6
    >>> True

### Combining Multiple Operators

Each comparison operator is one expression, but what if we want to combine expressions to check two conditions at the same time?

We can use the following keywords:

* and

  * Returns true if both conditions are true
  * If either condition is false, then it returns false

* or

  * Returns true if one or both conditions are true
  * Returns false if both conditions are false

* not

  * If a condition is true, it will make it false
  * If a condition is false, it will make it true

## Putting it to use

    #Asking the computer: Is 2 greater than 1 and is 2 less than 3?
    print(2 > 1 and 2 < 3)
    >>> True

    #Asking the computer: Is 5 less than 4 and is 6 greater than 5
    print(5 < 4 and 6 > 5)
    >>> False

    #Asking the computer: Is 5 less than 4 or is 5 greater than 5
    print(5 < 4 or 6 > 5)
    >>> True

    #Asking the computer: What is not True?
    print(not True)
    >>> False

    #Asking the computer: What is not False?
    print(not False)
    >>> True
