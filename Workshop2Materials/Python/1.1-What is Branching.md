# Introduction to Branching

## What is Branching?

In the last few lessons, we have learned about storing values inside variables and printing messages to the user using print statements.

Now we are going to learn how to control the order of what the computer does, this is branching!

Think of branching like being at a crossroads: You can go down Path A or Path B, you have a choice, and the choice you make changes what will happen on your adventure.

This is the same thing your computer does, given a set of conditions, the computer will choose between different paths to take based on what we tell it. This changes what the program will do in the end

## Why Do We Branch?

In programs we normally branch in order to respond to user input, check for certain conditions, generate the proper result, and do complex operations.

Without branching, our program would do the same thing over and over. We want our programs to be able to do different things in different situations.

## How Do We Use Branching?

Branching is all about decision making and we design programs to make certain decisions based on certain conditions.

Here are some examples:

- In a program that talks to you, we want to have different responses to what the user says
- For a weather app, we want to show a sun when it is above 70 degrees, but when it is cloudy, we want to a show a cloud
- When we make a game, we want to check if the player has enough points to beat a level, but if they don't have enough points, they have to play the level again
